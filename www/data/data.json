    "description": "Scala is famous in part for having one of the richest type systems of all mainstream programming languages today. Despite its reputation, Scala's type system remains one of the most under-documented and jargon-heavy aspects of Scala.\r\n\r\nThis talk will turn the academese into English, providing an example-rich tour of Scala\u2019s type system, covering all the things that make people call it \u201cpowerful\u201d. This talk isn't about showcasing a bunch of challenging little logical puzzles with types; on the contrary, this talk is about showing practical uses of Scala's type system, making it work for you and your users. We'll see how we can use it to improve usability by reducing boilerplate, meanwhile keeping code type-safe. From structural types, to type refinements, all the way to Scala's unique flavor of dependent types, we'll touch on the practical and not-so-practical of Scala's type system, all through examples. Finally, we'll go on to see what about Scala's type system is changing in dotty, the experimental new Scala compiler under active development at EPFL.",

Backbone.js was just six months old, ES5 had just started to land, and around half of the page views on the web came from IE 6, 7 or 8.\r\n\r\nFast forward to 2016: we have a number of great web frameworks, JavaScript is on an annual release schedule, and Chrome is ascendant. And while mobile phones drove negligible traffic in 2011, the picture is very different in 2016: four in ten page views came from iOS or Android last month.\r\n\r\nAs a project, Ember knows that it needs to stay ahead of changes to the web platform. At the same time, we are not willing to force our users to bear the burden of those changes. It's hard to build great apps without stability.\r\n\r\nThis tension is difficult to manage, but tackling it head on became our mantra: \"Stability without Stagnation.\"\r\n\r\nIn this talk, Yehuda will explain how Ember manages to stay on top of the latest trends without breaking applications, and has also managed to grow and maintain a large addon ecosystem.\r\n\r\nHe will also talk about some of the latest features in Ember and what's coming next.

Efficiency comes at a cost though: a single application may have as many as 100 different third party libraries implemented.

    "description": "Artificial Intelligence started with small data and rich semantic theories. The goal was to build systems that could reason over logical models of how the world worked; systems that could answer questions and provide intuitive, cognitively accessible explanations for their results. There was a tremendous focus on domain theory construction, formal deductive logics and efficient theorem proving. The problem, of course, was the knowledge acquisition bottleneck; it was too difficult, slow and costly to render all common sense knowledge into an integrated, formal representation that automated reasoning engines could digest. In the meantime, huge volumes of unstructured data became available, compute power became ever cheaper and statistical learning methods flourished. \r\n\r\nAI evolved from being predominantly theory-driven to predominantly data-driven. Automated systems generated output using inductive techniques. Training over machine learning algorithms over massive data produced flexible and capable control systems, powerful predictive engines in domains ranging from language translation to pattern recognition, from medicine to economics. But what do the models mean? From the very inception of Watson, I put a stake in the ground; we will use a diversity of shallow text analytics, leverage loose and fuzzy interpretations of unstructured information. We would allow many researchers to build largely independent NLP components and rely on machine learning techniques to balance and combine these loosely federated algorithms to evaluate answers in the context of human-readable passages. The approach, with a lot of good engineering, worked! Watson became arguably the best factoid question-answering system in the world. WatsonPaths, its descendant, could connect questions to answers over multiple steps, offering passage-based \u201cinference chains\u201d from question to answer without a human writing a single \u201cif-then rule.\u201d \r\n\r\nBut could it reason over a logical understanding of the domain? Could it fluently dialog or automatically learn from language and build the logical or cognitive structures that enable and precede language itself? Could it understand and learn the meaning behind the words the way we do? This talk draws an arc from Theory-Driven AI to Data-Driven AI and positions Watson along that trajectory. It proposes that to advance AI to where we all know it must go, we need to discover how to efficiently combine human cognition, massive data and logical theory formation. We need to boot strap a fluent collaboration between human and machine that engages logic, language and learning to enable machines to learn how to learn and ultimately deliver on the promise of AI.",

    "description": "The Node.js community has evolved a number of application design patterns for JavaScript applications, including application-internal package management patterns. The all-around awesomeness of NPM has lent itself to a hyper-modular approach for Node code not seen in many other language communities. This is great, especially when writing open-source tools designed to be used by others' applications. Meanwhile, the \"microservices\" or \"distributed systems\" architectural patterns have begun their ascendancy. It makes sense to isolate components so they can be managed independently of one another. One could be forgiven for thinking that \"many modules\" and \"microservices\" are similar answers to similar questions, but in fact they are completely orthogonal, as we found out the hard way.\r\n\r\nRecently, the Appium project, a large open-source application, decided to rewrite its codebase using ES2015, the newest version of JS. Not only that, we wanted to do a complete architectural overhaul, and in the process avail ourselves of all of the amazing new practices we'd heard lauded during conferences over the previous years. We went for it whole hog, and six months later we had our new application---all 45 modules' worth. It was beautiful! And it solved many of our problems. But alas, it came with new ones we had not anticipated in our headlong rush towards the hottest new ideas.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, I'll tell the story of what worked and what didn't. What were the goals of our rewrite and how did our choices deliver on those goals? Specifically, how did ES2015 and the \"many modules\" approach work for us? What could have worked better and where are we going from here? What tools did we use or invent to cover over any drawbacks of our approach?\r\n\r\nA degree of caution is important for any rewrite, especially when you are tempted to choose new languages or patterns because of their tantalizing buzzwordiness. On the other hand, there are many things you cannot know before you jump in, complete a project, look back, and ask how it went. What we learned is that the accepted Node wisdom, at least as we internalized it, doesn't apply to every kind of application. We needed to try things out and allow reality to humble us in order to eventually find the right patterns for our specific use case. Please, allow the false starts and dead ends we encountered to help you when you come to a rearchitecture of your own!",

    "description": "The concept of stream processing has been around for a while and most software systems operate as simple stream processors at their core: they read data in, process it, and maybe emit some data out. So why are there so many stream processing frameworks, all with different terminology, and why does it seem so complex to get up and running? What benefits does each stream processing system provide, and more importantly, what are they missing?\r\n\r\nThis presentation will start by abstracting away the individual frameworks and describe the key features and benefits that stream processing frameworks provide. These core features include scalability and parallelism through data partitioning, fault tolerance and event processing order guarantees, support for stateful stream processing, and handy stream processing primitives such as windowing. Understanding these features will enable you to map practical data problems to stream processing, write applications that process streams of data at scale, and understand how the different frameworks fit into the stream processing framework design space.\r\n\r\nNext, we'll describe Kafka's new stream processing library, Kafka Streams, and the design decisions and tradeoffs it makes. Kafka Streams represents a new design point in the stream processing space. Where most frameworks provide a service for running stream processing applications, Kafka Streams emphasizes low-overhead development that feels more like developing any other application. This trades off the benefits of a centrally-managed stream processing infrastructure for an easier adoption path and easy integration with your existing deployment tooling. Kafka Streams is also designed to work solely with Kafka. This limits its use to data that is already in Kafka and requires additional tools to import\/export data from other systems, but allows Kafka Streams to leverage unique Kafka features such as consumer groups to keep implementation complexity low and get scalability and fault tolerance nearly for free. Combined, these decisions represent a new design point for stream processing applications that we believe address use case not well served by today's popular frameworks.\r\n",

    "description": "To take full advantage of Java 8's support for lambdas and interfaces with concrete methods, a lot is changing behind the scenes of the Scala 2.12 compiler!\r\n\r\nAt the language level, Scala has always had first-class support for lambdas, of course, and with Java 8's invokedynamic machinery we can now compile them to more compact and efficient bytecode. We also interoperate fully with Java's modeling of functions as Single Abstract Method types  (aka functional interfaces). \r\n\r\nThe other advantage of compiling to Java 8 bytecode is a more direct encoding of traits. The invokedynamic instruction plays an interesting role here as well, surprisingly!\r\n\r\nWhile we were revamping the back-end, we've also replaced the old optimizer with a much more robust and powerful one, based on Miguel Garcia's earlier work.\r\n\r\nFinally, I'll talk about the crucial ingredients of my kind of functional programming language (beyond nice syntax for functions). Thrilling slide titles will include: \"val is your friend\", \"everything is an expression\", \"patterns for destruction\", \"how I stopped worrying about variance\".",

Such organizations do this by streamlining the flow of information, ideas, decision making, and work throughout the overall business process all the while improving the quality of the process and business outcomes. \r\n\r\nThis talk describes, step-by-step, how to evolve from today\u2019s vision of agile software development to a truly disciplined agile enterprise. It briefly examines the state of mainstream agile software development and argues for the need for a more disciplined approach to agile delivery that provides a solid foundation from which to scale. It then explores what it means to scale disciplined agile strategies tactically at the project\/product level and strategically across your IT organization as a whole. Your disciplined agile IT strategy, along with a lean business strategy, are key enablers of a full-fledged disciplined agile enterprise. The talk ends with advice for how to make this challenging organizational transition.\r\n\r\n<strong>You will learn:<\/strong>\r\n\r\n> How agile delivery works beginning to end with enterprise-class organizations\r\n\r\n> Understand what it means to tactically scale agile delivery \r\n\r\n> Understand what it means to strategically scale agile techniques across your IT department",

Velocity is simply a measurement of speed in a given direction; the rate at which a team is delivering toward a product release. As with a vehicle en route to a particular destination, increasing the speed may appear to ensure a timely arrival. However, that assumption is dangerous because it ignores the risks with higher speeds. And while it\u2019s easy to increase a vehicle\u2019s speed, where exactly is the accelerator on a software team?\r\n\r\nDoc walks us through the Hawthorne Effect and Goodhart\u2019s Law to explain why setting goals for velocity can actually hurt a project's chances. Take a look at what can negatively impact velocity, ways to stabilize fluctuating velocity, and methods to improve velocity without the risks. Leave with a toolkit of additional metrics that, coupled with velocity, give a better view of the project's overall health.",
